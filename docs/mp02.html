<p>To do so, this project uses data made available by <a href="https://datasets.imdbws.com/">Internet Movie Database (IMDb)</a>.

<p>With that, the data has been narrowed down significantly. One thing to point out is that the sub-setting may result in ‘dangling’ references.</p>

<p>The results of this first query says Robert De Visee but Robert was born in 1655, which does not make sense at all. A quick Google search says that the oldest person alive in 2024 is 116. Given that, let us filter for people born after 1914.</p>

<li>The TV series Happy Days (1974-1984) gives us the common idiom “jump the shark”. The phrase comes from a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) in which a lead character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Idiomatically, it is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and rapidly looses quality. Is it true that episodes from later seasons of Happy Days have lower average ratings than the early seasons?</li>

<h1>Quantifying Success</h1>
<p>Next, I will be designing a ‘success’ measure for IMDb entries, reflecting both quality and broad popular awareness. I will be adding this measure to the TITLE_RATINGS table.</p>
<p>Initially, I did a composite score of averageRating and numVotes to consider both quality and popularity. I then divided this by the max possible score in the data population.<br>
(averageRating x numVotes ) / (max(averageRating) x max(numVotes))</p>

<p>I don’t want the number of votes to throw off the score. Let’s use log on numVotes and maybe I want to give more weight to the rating than the number of votes.</p>

<p>To come up with a numerical threshold for a project to be a ‘success’ and determine a value such that movies above are all “solid” or better, I am going to use summary statistics. The 3rd Q is 0.6 and so I thinkk a score greater than 0.6 is “solid” and above the average movie.</p>

<p>As I develop my team, I want to consider the benefits of pairing an older, established actor—someone with over 20 successful titles—to lend credibility and experience, alongside an up-and-coming actor who can bring fresh energy and appeal to a younger audience. This combination can create a dynamic synergy that enhances the project’s overall impact.</p>
<p>When working with NAME_BASICS, I can only have alive personnel on my team.</p>

<p>To find up and coming actors, I tried a couple of ways to define the criteria for “up and coming”. What if we consider mean success score? We could find top scoring actors but with low success counts.</p>

<p>Michael Conner Humphreys has only been in 1 film where he played young Forrest Gump. This does not seem like the best way to define up and coming. I do want someone with a higher success count. What if I limit it to between 5 and 10 successful titles.</p>

<p>Ryan Reynolds, Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Timothee Chalamet, Dave Bautistqa… I don’t think I could consider them up and coming actors. Let us adjust adjust again. It seems like the startYear lowers the success count. It only counts for recent movies and so established actors show up too because their earlier successes are not counted. Does up and coming mean young or just that their first movie was recent? I think older personell can be up and coming if they are just coming into the scene. Let’s try looking at the minimum start year of their movies.</p>
