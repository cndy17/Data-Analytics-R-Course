<p>The results of this first query says Robert De Visee but Robert was born in 1655, which does not make sense at all. A quick Google search says that the oldest person alive in 2024 is 116. Given that, let us filter for people born after 1914.</p>

<p><strong>6. Is it true that episodes from later seasons of Happy Days have lower average ratings than the early seasons?</strong> The TV series Happy Days (1974-1984) gives us the common idiom “jump the shark”. The phrase comes from a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) in which a lead character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Idiomatically, it is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and rapidly looses quality.</p>
<p>First, I’m finding the tconst for Happy Days.</p>

<p>We can see below that seasons 1 through 4 do well in terms of average rating. Aside from season 11, the seasons after season 5 are all in the bottom half of ratings. Meanwhile, season 3 has the highest rating of 7.7.</p>

<h1>Quantifying Success</h1>
<p>Next, I will be designing a ‘success’ measure for IMDb entries, reflecting both quality and broad popular awareness. I will be adding this measure to the TITLE_RATINGS table.</p>
<p>Initially, I did a composite score of averageRating and numVotes to consider both quality and popularity. I then divided this by the max possible score in the data population.<br>
(averageRating x numVotes ) / (max(averageRating) x max(numVotes))</p>

<p>I don’t want the number of votes to throw off the score. Let’s use log on numVotes and maybe I want to give more weight to the rating than the number of votes. (0.6 x averageRating + 0.4 x log(numVotes)) / (0.6 x max(averageRating) + 0.4 x log(max(numVotes)))</p>

<p>Now that there is a success score, let’s validate the metric with a number of tests and see how it holds up. First, I’m confirming that the the top 5-10 movies based on my metric were indeed box office successes.</p>

<p>To come up with a numerical threshold for a project to be a ‘success’ and determine a value such that movies above are all “solid” or better, I am going to use summary statistics. The 3rd Q is 0.6 and so I thinkk a score greater than 0.6 is “solid” and above the average movie.</p>

<p>As I develop my team, I want to consider the benefits of pairing an older, established actor—someone with over 20 successful titles—to lend credibility and experience, alongside an up-and-coming actor who can bring fresh energy and appeal to a younger audience. This combination can create a dynamic synergy that enhances the project’s overall impact.</p>
<p>When working with NAME_BASICS, I can only have alive personnel on my team. Here, I am creating a new data frame called ALIVE_NAME_BASICS.</p>

<p>Ryan Reynolds, Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Timothee Chalamet, Dave Bautistqa… I don’t think I could consider them up and coming actors. Let us adjust adjust again. It seems like the startYear lowers the success count. It only counts for recent movies and so established actors show up too because their earlier successes are not counted. Does up and coming mean young or just that their first movie was recent? I think older personell can be up and coming if they are just coming into the scene. Let’s try looking at the minimum start year of their first titles</p>

<p>Peter Jackson is the director of the Hobit. We can see how directors of franchises and TV series may skew the success count.</p>
<p>What if we look at a specific director to see what actors and actresses they work well with. For example, if I wanted Greta Gerwig. Who has she worked well with in the past?</p>

<p>The original has a large number of IMDb ratings, a high average rating, and has not been remade in the past 25 years. A Princess Bride Home Movie was created during COVID, a miniseries shot on phones from home, but a full film remake would be very successful.</p>
<p>Let’s confirm whether key actors, directors, or writers from the original are still alive.</p>
