Passengers are counted each time they board vehicles no matter how many vehicles they use to travel from their origin to their destination.\nNow,, here’s a sample of the processed Usage Data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Usage and Financial Data\nNext, we can join the Usage and Financial Data sets.\nIn order to do so, we need to get the Usage for 2022 in order to match the 2022 Financial data.\nSince we are joining on Mode, we need to convert the modes of the Financials data as well.\nAfter that, we can LEFT JOIN the two data sets.\nLet’s take a look at the Usage and Financials data."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn terms of ridership, the MTA New York City Transit takes the win in with the most Vehicle Revenue Miles and the most Unlinked Passenger Trips in 2022. Ridership in the NYC, NJ, Newark area overall is the highest and the transit systems in the area are some of the most utilized public transit systems in the US. Financially, San Francisco’s BART Heavy Rail/Subway comes out on top with both the lowest expense per VRM and lowest expense per UPT. Additionally, San Francisco/Oakland, CA also offers the most modes of transportation. When it comes to usage, the MTA is the transit system that shines, covering the most revenue miles with its vehicles and servicing the most passenger trips. When finances are added to the picture, the BART seems to be the most cost effective transit system."
